# SEARCH LIBRARY

Python library that helps on searching elements in an ordered array. There is here two manners of searching: linear and binary.

# HOW TO USE IT?

1. First of all, you need to get this code, so copy and paste the code of **search.py** into a **.py** file on your computer or clone this repository into the folder you are going to utilize it.
2. Then, on the file you will use this library you want to let the code know that it exists, so call the library typing    
__from search import *__.
3. And finally, you can run the funcions inside the library. To do that, type: linear(the array is the first argument, the thing   
your searching for is the second argument). The same is valid to binary() function.

As you can see in the image above, the functions on search library output a **boolean value** (True or False).
