# SORT LIBRARY

This library contains three different ways to sort lists (ascending order or descending order) to run in **python programs**: selection, bubble and merge sort. And it was created through knowledge gained in **[Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home)** on Edx.

# HOW TO USE IT?

1. Get the library by copying and pasting it into a **.py file** on your computer;
2. Put the library into your code typing __from sort import *__;
3. Now you can use any function: merge_sort(), bubble_sort() and/or selection_sort();
4. Those functions take two arguments (first is the unordered list, second the is the sorting manner (ascending or descending);
5. Into the second aguments of the functions type **""** to sort in ascending order or **"r"**, **"R"** or **"reverse"** to sort in descending order.
